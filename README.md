## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Connexus on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java** (JDK 11 or later)
- **Spring Boot** (via Spring Initializr or your existing Spring Boot project setup)
- **Windows** (for setting environment variables on Windows)
- **Google and GitHub Accounts**: You'll need to have accounts with both Google and GitHub to create OAuth credentials.
- **Spring Boot Project**: Clone or set up your Spring Boot project.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository. Copy the link from the code option in the repository in github. Run the command : `git clone {the link you'll get}` and navigating into the project directory with `cd Review1`.

2. **Database Setup**: Create a new database (e.g., `connexus_db`) in your SQL database. Then, open the `application.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory and update the database connection settings. The properties should look like this: 

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/{your db name}
   spring.datasource.username= {your username}
   spring.datasource.password= {your password}
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   
Change the localhost:port according the default port of your database.
Replace the placeholders {your db name}, {your username}, {your password} with the corresponding values.

Once youâ€™ve configured the database, proceed to install the necessary dependencies. Open a terminal in the project directory and run `mvn clean install` to download and install all required packages using Maven. This will ensure that all dependencies are set up correctly for the project to function as intended. Also run `npm install` to download the node dependencies.

#### If Maven(mvn) is not installed, follow the given steps:

## Apache Maven Installation Guide

Apache Maven is a powerful build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Follow these steps to install Maven on your system.

### Step 1: Download Apache Maven

1. Visit the official [Apache Maven Download Page](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
2. Download the latest binary archive:
    - **Windows:** `apache-maven-<version>-bin.zip`
    - **Linux/macOS:** `apache-maven-<version>-bin.tar.gz`

### Step 2: Extract the Archive

#### For Windows:

- Use tools like **7-Zip**, **WinRAR**, or **Windows Explorer** to extract the archive.
- Move the extracted folder to a directory like:
    
    ```makefile
    C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven
    ```
    

#### For Linux/macOS:

- Open a terminal and run the following command to extract:
    
    ```bash
    tar -xvzf apache-maven-<version>-bin.tar.gz -C /opt
    ```
    
- The Maven directory will now be located at `/opt/apache-maven-<version>`.

   
### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

#### For Windows:

1. Open **System Properties**:
    - Right-click **This PC** (or **My Computer**) > **Properties** > **Advanced System Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
2. Add a new system variable:
    - **Variable name:** `MAVEN_HOME`
    - **Variable value:** `C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven`
3. Update the `PATH` variable:
    - Select `PATH` in **System Variables**, click **Edit**, and add:
        
        ```perl
        ;%MAVEN_HOME%\bin
        ```
        
#### For Linux/macOS:

1. Open your shell configuration file:
    - For **Bash** users: `~/.bashrc`
    - For **Zsh** users: `~/.zshrc`
    
    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```
    
2. Add the following lines to the file:
    
    ```bash
    export MAVEN_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-<version>
    export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH
    ```
    
3. Save the file and reload the configuration:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    mvn -v

If you have face any difficulty in any of the tailwind configuration, run this command in terminal: `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/main/resources/static/css/input.css -o ./src/main/resources/static/css/output.css --watch
`.

## Setting Up OAuth Credentials in Spring Boot

1. **Set Up Environment Variables on Your System**:
   Store your Google and GitHub OAuth credentials as environment variables on your system to keep them secure.

   ### For Google:
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - Run the following commands to set the credentials as environment variables:

     ```cmd
     setx GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID "your-google-client-id"
     setx GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET "your-google-client-secret"

     ```

   ### For GitHub:
   - Run the following commands to set the credentials as environment variables:

     ```cmd
     setx GITHUB_CLIENT_ID "your-github-client-id"
     setx GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET "your-github-client-secret"
     ```

   > **Note**: Make sure to replace `"your-google-client-id"`, `"your-google-client-secret"`, `"your-github-client-id"`, and `"your-github-client-secret"` with the actual values you obtained from the Google and GitHub Developer consoles.

2. **Use the Environment Variables in `application.properties`**:
   In your `application.properties` or `application.yml`, reference the environment variables like this:

   ```properties
   # application.properties
   spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=${GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
   spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=${GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET}

   spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-id=${GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}
   spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.github.client-secret=${GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}
   
   
# Creating Cloudinary Configuration

This will provide step-by-step instructions for integrating Cloudinary into your Spring Boot project using the `application.properties` file.



## Prerequisites

1. A Cloudinary account. If you donâ€™t have one, you can create it [here](https://cloudinary.com/).
2. Access to your Cloudinary dashboard to obtain the API credentials.



## Steps to Configure Cloudinary

### 1. Obtain API Credentials
1. Log in to your Cloudinary account.
2. Navigate to the **Dashboard**.
3. Note down the following credentials:
   - `cloud_name`
   - `api_key`
   - `api_secret`



### 2. Add Credentials to `application.properties`

Add the following lines to your `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:
```properties
cloudinary.cloud.name=${CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME}
clodinary.api.key=${CLOUDINARY_API_KEY}
cloudinary.api.secret=${CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET}

---
Replace the placeholders ${CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME}, ${CLOUDINARY_API_KEY}, ${CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET} with the corresponding values from your Cloudinary dashboard.

After the dependencies are installed and OAuth credentials setup you can start the application. Use your IDE's run feature, or in the terminal, execute `mvn spring-boot:run`. This command will launch the application and make it accessible locally.

With the application running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8081/home`. Here, you should see the Connexus login page, which confirms that the application is up and running. You can explore all the available features within the app. Other pages are still being developed.

If you encounter any issues, ensure that all configurations are correct and that the database server is running. Additional troubleshooting might involve checking the logs or verifying the database connection in the `application.properties` file.
